## Content

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce the application development environment available on the HPC service and give hands on practice managing, installing and compiling codes on the HPC service. This workshop will be most useful for researchers who need to manage and install their own applications and research codes. This workshop builds on the skills developed on the [HPC 1: Introduction to High Performance Computing at Leeds](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/hpc1/) workshop. No previous experience of compiling or managing code is expected, although experience with the Linux command line and some programming experience would be very useful. It is not an introductory programming workshop (see workshops [SWD1a: Introduction to Python programming](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/swd1a/), [SWD1b: Introduction to R programming](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/swd1b/) if that is what you need).

## Objectives

At the end of this workshop, learners will be able to:

1. [ ] Understand what an executable is 
2. [ ] Understand the how filesystem configuration and environment variables relate to software
3. [ ] Develop hands on experience with:
    1. [ ] Building software using GNU Autotools
    2. [ ] Using spack package manager
    3. [ ] Using conda package manager
    4. [ ] Building software using cmake
    5. [ ] Building software using RPMs
    6. [ ] Interacting and using singularity/Apptainer containers
    7. [ ] Building personal modules on HPC

## Prerequisites

We recommend that attendees have a working knowledge of the Unix shell (although this is not essential) and an overview of the High Performance Computing service at Leeds. The course [HPC1: Introduction to high performance computing at Leeds](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/hpc1/) is a prerequisite. If you are unfamilair with the unix shell we would encourage you to attend [HPC0: Introduction to Command Line Linux](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/training/courses/hpc0/).
